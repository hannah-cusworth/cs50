# CS50's Introduction to Computer Science 
All my solutions to problem sets from Harvard's [Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/).
In it's own words: "Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. "

Languages:
* C
* Python 
* SQL
* HTML/CSS/Javascript
